# RuntimeMeshLoader
RuntimeMeshLoader for UE4  

This repo was achieved. If you need the same feature like this, I recommend glTFRuntime(https://github.com/rdeioris/glTFRuntime).
  
Use this plugin with ProceduralMeshComponent, you can load mesh with Blueprint in runtime,support relative and absolute Path.
